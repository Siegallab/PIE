If you get a "Unicode" error in analysis_configuration._AnalysisConfigFileProcessor.process_analysis_config_file, it probably means there's an issue with the setup file you're using for the experiment. This can happen when this file is re-saved in excel. Open the setup file in excel and make sure that it looks the way you expect (4 columns, lots of rows), and that you haven't entered any special characters (e.g. รง); then, select all, copy, open a new excel file, and paste. Re-save over the old file and make sure that you're saving the file as 'CSV (Unicode-8)'. Try re-running the code.
