Parameter,Default Value,Explanation
minimum_growth_time,1,smallest number of timepoints in which an object needs to be independently tracked in order to be considered a colony for the purposes of determining distance between neighboring colonies
max_area_pixel_decrease,Inf,the maximum allowed decrease in area between subsequent timepoints (in pixels); all subsequent timepoints in the GR calculation after an area decrease greater than this amount are ignored (Inf for no cutoff)
max_area_fold_decrease,Inf,The cutoff decrease in area between subsequent timepoints (as a fraction of total cell area); all subsequent timepoints in the GR calculation after an area decrease greater than this amount are ignored (Inf for no cutoff)
max_area_fold_increase,Inf,The cutoff increase in area between subsequent timepoints (as a fraction of total cell area); all subsequent timepoints in the GR calculation after an area increase greater than this amount are ignored (Inf for no cutoff)
min_colony_area,0,The minimum area (in pixels) for a cololy timepoint to be counted toward the GR calculation; must be at least 0
max_colony_area,Inf,The maximum area (in pixels) for a cololy timepoint to be counted toward the GR calculation
min_correlation,-1,The minimum log linear correlation over all acceptable timepoints for the colony GR to be included in the population; setting to ~0.9 likely filters for eggregious image analysis issues at individual timepoints
min_foldX,0,The minimum fold increase in area that a colony must have at some point within the growth window. Can be used to filter out e.g. dead cells
max_colony_num,1000,The maximum number of colonies allowed in an image; images with more colonies detected will be treated as blank. This is an important failsafe in case thresholding fails. It should be an order of magnitude higher than the expected number of colonies. Setting this number to >10000 is not recommended as tracking images with that many colonies may result in out-of-memory errors
