Parameter,Default Value,Explanation
hole_fill_area,Inf,"Size (in pixels) of the largest empty space between cells (on the inside of a colony) to consider part of the colony. If set to Inf all intercell spaces within a colony are filled; if set to 0, no intercell spaces are filled. Intercell space is not typically easily identified in colonies of round cells; for these we recommend first trying the default setting (Inf). However intercell space can often be accurately parsed in colonies of rod-shaped cells"
cleanup,FALSE,Whether to perform recursive cleanup step to remove pieces of background detected as part of the colony. This is helpful in certain imaging conditions but can result in parts of real colonies being missed; we recommend first trying analysis on a set of images without cleanup first. Images taken under identical imaging conditions should be consistent in whether or not they require cleanup.
max_proportion_exposed_edge,0.75,The max proportion of the edge of a detected colony 'pie piece' that is allowed to not touch a neighboring pie piece before being removed during cleanup step. Recommended to be set to 0.6-0.75. **Only applies during cleanup steps.**
perform_registration,TRUE,Whether to perform image registration between subsequent images in PhaseNum before determining colony tracking; recommended to be set to True except in cases when there is a small number of colonies (<5) or many spurious objects. Registration will only be performed between phases if perform_registration is set to True for every PhaseNum
