Parameter,Explanation
output_path,Full path to folder from in which image analysis and growth rate outputs will be stored ACROSS ALL PHASES
input_path,Full path to folder from which images for this phase will be drawn (PHASE-SPECIFIC)
im_format,Format in which images are saved; can be either 'individual' (i.e. where every timepoint-position-channel combination is saved to its own image) or 'stack' (i.e. where every image at a position is saved to a single file)
im_file_extension,File extension for image files in input_dir
label_order_list,Order in which timepoint position and channel are listed in filenames (separated by semicolons): e.g. channel;timepoint;position when for image names like c2t01xy4030. Note that all three elements must be specified in label_order_list even if imaging does not include one of them
position_label_prefix,Label to be used for positions (e.g. 'xy' if position labels look like xy001); if left blank position label will not be included in filename
timepoint_label_prefix,Label to be used for timepoints (e.g. 't' if position labels look like t01); if left blank timepoint label will not be included in filename
main_channel_label,Label used by the microscope for the main channel being imaged (e.g. 'c1'); if channel is not labeled channel label will not be included in filename
main_channel_imagetype,Type of image in the main channel of this phase; can be 'brightfield' or 'phase_contrast'
total_xy_position_num,Highest imaged xy position number
total_timepoint_num,Highest imaged timepoint number
timepoint_spacing,Spacing between timepoints (in seconds). Can be left blank to extract this information from file modification times; an integer for evenly spaced timepoints; or consecutive numbers separated by semicolons to provide the time at which each timepoint image was taken
growth_window_timepoints,number of timepoints to include in growth rate calculation. Report the highest growth rate for a colony calculated from growth_window_timepoints consecutive timepoints
min_neighbor_dist,The minimum distance in pixels that a colony must be from its closest neighbor in order to be included in growth rate calculations; colonies at half this distance from the image edge will also be excluded. Because colonies that are close to each other tend to collide too early for their growth rates to be calculated having colonies be too close to each other at the start of the experiment will bias counting towards slow-growing colonies that don't have a chance to collide before reaching enough timepoints to fulfill the growth_window_timepoints cutoff
