        If you are using a Linux or MacOS operating system, python comes pre-installed on your computer. All you need to do to uninstall the PIE package is open the Terminal application, paste the following line, and press 'enter'.

        .. code-block:: bash

            python -m pip uninstall PIE

    .. tab:: Windows

        You should have python installed on your computer during the installation of PIE. If not, you can download the latest version for free from the Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/


        Once you have python installed, open the ``cmd`` program from the Start Menu, and type the following:

        .. code-block:: bash

            py -m pip uninstall PIE
