Parameter,Value,Explanationoutput_path,PIE_test_data/out/SL_180519_small_first_phase,Full path to folder from in which image analysis and growth rate outputs will be stored ACROSS ALL PHASESim_file_extension,tif,File extension for image files in input_dirim_format,individual,Format in which images are saved; can be either 'individual' (i.e. where every timepoint-position-channel combination is saved to its own image) or 'stack' (i.e. where every image at a position is saved to a single file)main_channel_imagetype,brightfield,Type of image in the main channel of this phase; can be 'brightfield' or 'phase_contrast',,label_order_list,timepoint;position;channel,Order in which timepoint position and channel are listed in filenames (separated by semicolons): e.g. channel;timepoint;position when for image names like c2t01xy4030. Note that all three elements must be specified in label_order_list even if imaging does not include one of themposition_label_prefix,xy,Label to be used for positions (e.g. 'xy' if position labels look like xy001); if left blank position label will not be included in filenametimepoint_label_prefix,t,Label to be used for timepoints (e.g. 't' if position labels look like t01); if left blank timepoint label will not be included in filenamemain_channel_label,c1,Label used by the microscope for the main channel being imaged (e.g. 'c1'); if channel is not labeled channel label will not be included in filenamefirst_timepoint,1,First timepoint at which time count starts (likely 1 or 0)total_xy_position_num,1000,Highest imaged xy position numberextended_display_positions,401;402,list of imaging positions (as integers separated by semicolons) for which additional image processing info (eg threshold plots and colony mask boundaries overlaid on original images) are saved,,input_path,PIE_test_data/IN/SL_180519_small/SL_180519_2_GR,Full path to folder from which images for this phase will be drawn (PHASE-SPECIFIC)timepoint_spacing,3600,Spacing between timepoints (in seconds). Can be left blank to extract this information from file modification times; an integer for evenly spaced timepoints; or consecutive numbers separated by semicolons to provide the time at which each timepoint image was takentotal_timepoint_num,5,Highest imaged timepoint number,,fluor_channel_scope_labels,c2;c3,Labels in the filename for each fluorescent channel being imaged (e.g. 'c2'); separated by semicolonsfluor_channel_names,MitoTracker;GFP,Names for each additional_channel_label as they show up in the final dataframe column labels (e.g. 'RFP' 'mito_label' etc); separated by semicolonsfluor_channel_timepoints,first_tracked;last_gr,Timepoints for which fluorescent data is to be included in growth rate output; separated by semicolons for each channel. The options for this are: an integer corresponding to the timepoint number; 'last_gr' or 'first_gr' - the last or first timepoint for which a growth rate was measured; 'last_tracked' or 'first_tracked' - the last or first timepoint at which a colony was tracked; and 'mean' 'median' 'min' or 'max': summary statistic across all tracked timepointsfluor_channel_thresholds,Inf,Thresholds to be used for removing saturated pixels in images (in absolute intensity); separated by semicolons,,growth_window_timepoints,3,number of timepoints to include in growth rate calculation. Report the highest growth rate for a colony calculated from growth_window_timepoints consecutive timepoints
