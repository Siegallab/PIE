Parameter,Value,PhaseNum,Explanationoutput_path,PIE_test_data/out/EP_170202_small,all,Full path to folder from in which image analysis and growth rate outputs will be stored ACROSS ALL PHASESim_file_extension,jpg,1,File extension for image files in input_dirim_file_extension,tif,2,File extension for image files in input_dirim_format,individual,all,Format in which images are saved; can be either 'individual' (i.e. where every timepoint-position-channel combination is saved to its own image) or 'stack' (i.e. where every image at a position is saved to a single file)main_channel_imagetype,brightfield,1,Type of image in the main channel of this phase; can be 'brightfield' or 'phase_contrast',,,label_order_list,channel;timepoint;position,all,Order in which timepoint position and channel are listed in filenames (separated by semicolons): e.g. channel;timepoint;position when for image names like c2t01xy4030. Note that all three elements must be specified in label_order_list even if imaging does not include one of themposition_label_prefix,xy,all,Label to be used for positions (e.g. 'xy' if position labels look like xy001); if left blank position label will not be included in filenametimepoint_label_prefix,t,1,Label to be used for timepoints (e.g. 't' if position labels look like t01); if left blank timepoint label will not be included in filenamemain_channel_label,,1,Label used by the microscope for the main channel being imaged (e.g. 'c1'); if channel is not labeled channel label will not be included in filenametimepoint_label_prefix,,2,Label to be used for timepoints (e.g. 't' if position labels look like t01); if left blank timepoint label will not be included in filenamefirst_timepoint,1,1,First timepoint at which time count starts (likely 1 or 0)first_xy_position,1,all,First xy position at which time count starts (likely 1 or 0)total_xy_position_num,1000,all,Highest imaged xy position numberextended_display_positions,735;736;737;738;739,all,list of imaging positions (as integers separated by semicolons) for which additional image processing info (eg threshold plots and colony mask boundaries overlaid on original images) are saved,,,hole_fill_area,Inf,1,Size (in pixels) of the largest empty space between cells (on the inside of a colony) to consider part of the colony. Intercell space is not typically easily identified in colonies of round cells; for these we recommend first trying the default setting (Inf). However intercell space can often be accurately parsed in colonies of rod-shaped cellscleanup,FALSE,1,Whether to perform recursive cleanup step to remove pieces of background detected as part of the colony. This is helpful in certain imaging conditions but can result in parts of real colonies being missed; we recommend first trying analysis on a set of images without cleanup first. Images taken under identical imaging conditions should be consistent in whether or not they require cleanup.max_proportion_exposed_edge,0.75,1,The max proportion of the edge of a detected colony 'pie piece' that is allowed to not touch a neighboring pie piece before being removed during cleanup step. Recommended to be set to 0.6-0.75. Only applies during cleanup steps.perform_registration,TRUE,1,Whether to perform image registration between subsequent images in PhaseNum before determining colony tracking; recommended to be set to True except in cases when there is a small number of colonies (<5) or many spurious objects. Registration will only be performed between phases if perform_registration is set to True for every PhaseNum,,,input_path,PIE_test_data/IN/EP_170202_small/EP_170202_2_GR,1,Full path to folder from which images for this phase will be drawn (PHASE-SPECIFIC)timepoint_spacing,3600,1,Spacing between timepoints (in seconds). Can be left blank to extract this information from file modification times; an integer for evenly spaced timepoints; or consecutive numbers separated by semicolons to provide the time at which each timepoint image was takentotal_timepoint_num,10,1,Highest imaged timepoint numberinput_path,PIE_test_data/IN/EP_170202_small/EP_170202_2_FC,2,Full path to folder from which images for this phase will be drawn (PHASE-SPECIFIC),,,fluor_channel_scope_labels,,2,Labels in the filename for each fluorescent channel being imaged (e.g. 'c2'); separated by semicolons for each channelfluor_channel_names,GFP,2,Names for each additional_channel_label as they show up in the final dataframe column labels (e.g. 'RFP' 'mito_label' etc); separated by semicolons for each channelfluor_channel_thresholds,inf,2,Thresholds to be used for removing saturated pixels in images (in absolute intensity); separated by semicolons for each channelfluor_channel_timepoints,last_gr,2,Timepoints for which fluorescent data is to be included in growth rate output; separated by semicolons for each channel. The options for this are: an integer corresponding to the timepoint number; 'last_gr' or 'first_gr' - the last or first timepoint for which a growth rate was measured; 'last_tracked' or 'first_tracked' - the last or first timepoint at which a colony was tracked; and 'mean' 'median' 'min' or 'max': summary statistic across all tracked timepointsparent_phase,1,2,PhaseNum whose final timepoint is used as the main_channel image for this phase; leave blank if current phase includes brightfield or phase contrast images,,,growth_window_timepoints,7,1,number of timepoints to include in growth rate calculation. Report the highest growth rate for a colony calculated from growth_window_timepoints consecutive timepointsmin_neighbor_dist,100,1,The minimum distance in pixels that a colony must be from its closest neighbor in order to be included in growth rate calculations; colonies at half this distance from the image edge will also be excluded. Because colonies that are close to each other tend to collide too early for their growth rates to be calculated having colonies be too close to each other at the start of the experiment will bias counting towards slow-growing colonies that don't have a chance to collide before reaching enough timepoints to fulfill the growth_window_timepoints cutoff
