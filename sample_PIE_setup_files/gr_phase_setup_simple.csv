Parameter,Value,Explanationoutput_path,PIE_test_data/out/SL_170619_2_GR_small,Full path to folder from in which image analysis and growth rate outputs will be stored ACROSS ALL PHASESim_file_extension,tif,File extension for image files in input_dirim_format,individual,Format in which images are saved; can be either 'individual' (i.e. where every timepoint-position-channel combination is saved to its own image) or 'stack' (i.e. where every image at a position is saved to a single file)main_channel_imagetype,brightfield,Type of image in the main channel of this phase; can be 'brightfield' or 'phase_contrast',,label_order_list,timepoint;position,Order in which timepoint position and channel are listed in filenames (separated by semicolons): e.g. channel;timepoint;position for image names like c2t01xy4030 or position;timepoint for image names like xy420t5position_label_prefix,xy,Label to be used for positions (e.g. 'xy' if position labels look like xy001); if left blank position label will not be included in filenametimepoint_label_prefix,t,Label to be used for timepoints (e.g. 't' if position labels look like t01); if left blank timepoint label will not be included in filenamemain_channel_label,,Label (e.g. 'c1') used by the microscope for the main channel being imaged from which cell segmentation occurs (i.e. the bright field or phase contrast channel); if blank channel label will not be included in filenametotal_xy_position_num,1000,Highest imaged xy position numberextended_display_positions,4;11,list of imaging positions (as integers separated by semicolons) for which additional image processing info (eg threshold plots and colony mask boundaries overlaid on original images) are saved,,input_path,PIE_test_data/IN/SL_170619_2_GR_small,Full path to folder from which images for this phase will be drawn (PHASE-SPECIFIC)timepoint_spacing,3600,Spacing between timepoints (in seconds). Can be left blank to extract this information from file modification times; an integer for evenly spaced timepoints; or consecutive numbers separated by semicolons to provide the time at which each timepoint image was takentotal_timepoint_num,10,Highest imaged timepoint number,,growth_window_timepoints,7,number of timepoints to include in growth rate calculation. Report the highest growth rate for a colony calculated from growth_window_timepoints consecutive timepoints
