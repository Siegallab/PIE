Note that all three elements must be specified in label_order_list even if imaging does not include one of themposition_label_prefix,xy,all,Label to be used for positions (e.g. 'xy' if position labels look like xy001); if left blank position label will not be included in filenametimepoint_label_prefix,t,1,Label to be used for timepoints (e.g. 't' if position labels look like t01); if left blank timepoint label will not be included in filenametimepoint_label_prefix,,2,Label to be used for timepoints (e.g. 't' if position labels look like t01); if left blank timepoint label will not be included in filenamefirst_timepoint,1,all,First timepoint at which time count starts (likely 1 or 0)first_xy_position,1,all,First xy position at which time count starts (likely 1 or 0)max_xy_position_num,1000,all,Highest imaged xy position numberextended_display_positions,735;736;737;738;739,all,list of imaging positions (as integers separated by semicolons) for which additional image processing info (eg threshold plots and colony mask boundaries overlaid on original images) are saved,,,hole_fill_area,Inf,all,"Size (in pixels) of the largest empty space between cells (on the inside of a colony) to consider part of the colony. Intercell space is not typically easily identified in colonies of round cells; for these we recommend first trying the default setting (Inf). However, intercell space can often be accurately parsed in colonies of rod-shaped cells"cleanup,FALSE,all,Whether to perform recursive cleanup step to remove pieces of background detected as part of the colony. This is helpful in certain imaging conditions but can result in parts of real colonies being missed; we recommend first trying analysis on a set of images without cleanup first. Images taken under identical imaging conditions should be consistent in whether or not they require cleanup.max_proportion_exposed_edge,0.75,all,The max proportion of the edge of a detected colony ÃŒÃŽÃŒÃ¼pie pieceÃŒÃŽÃ¥Â that is allowed to not touch a neighboring pie piece before being removed during cleanup step.

The options for this are: an integer corresponding to the timepoint number; 'last_gr' or 'first_gr' - the last or first timepoint for which a growth rate was measured; 'last_tracked' or 'first_tracked' - the last or first timepoint at which a colony was tracked; and 'mean' 'median' 'min' or 'max': summary statistic across all tracked timepointslinked_phase,,1,PhaseNum whose final timepoint is used as the main_channel image for this phase; leave blank if current phase includes brightfield or phase contrast images,,,fluor_channel_scope_labels,,2,Labels in the filename for each fluorescent channel being imaged (e.g. 'c2'); separated by semicolons for each channelfluor_channel_names,GFP,2,Names for each additional_channel_label as they show up in the final dataframe column labels (e.g. 'RFP' 'mito_label' etc); separated by semicolons for each channelfluor_channel_thresholds,inf,2,Thresholds to be used for removing saturated pixels in images (in absolute intensity); separated by semicolons for each channelfluor_channel_timepoints,last_gr,2,Timepoints for which fluorescent data is to be included in growth rate output; separated by semicolons for each channel. The options for this are: an integer corresponding to the timepoint number; 'last_gr' or 'first_gr' - the last or first timepoint for which a growth rate was measured; 'last_tracked' or 'first_tracked' - the last or first timepoint at which a colony was tracked; and 'mean' 'median' 'min' or 'max': summary statistic across all tracked timepointslinked_phase,1,2,PhaseNum whose final timepoint is used as the main_channel image for this phase; leave blank if current phase includes brightfield or phase contrast images,,,minimum_growth_time,4,1,smallest number of timepoints in which an object needs to be independently tracked in order to be considered a colony for the purposes of determining distance between neighboring coloniesgrowth_window_timepoints,7,1,number of timepoints to include in growth rate calculation. Report the highest growth rate for a colony calculated from growth_window_timepoints consecutive timepointsmax_area_pixel_decrease,500,1,the maximum allowed decrease in area between subsequent timepoints (in pixels); all subsequent timepoints in the GR calculation after an area decrease greater than this amount are ignored (Inf for no cutoff)max_area_fold_decrease,2,1,The cutoff decrease in area between subsequent timepoints (as a fraction of total cell area); all subsequent timepoints in the GR calculation after an area decrease greater than this amount are ignored (Inf for no cutoff)max_area_fold_increase,6,1,The cutoff increase in area between subsequent timepoints (as a fraction of total cell area); all subsequent timepoints in the GR calculation after an area increase greater than this amount are ignored (Inf for no cutoff)min_colony_area,30,1,The minimum area (in pixels) for a cololy timepoint to be counted toward the GR calculation; must be at least 0max_colony_area,Inf,1,The maximum area (in pixels) for a cololy timepoint to be counted toward the GR calculationmin_correlation,0.9,1,The minimum log linear correlation over all acceptable timepoints for the colony GR to be included in the population; setting to ~0.9 likely filters for eggregious image analysis issues at individual timepointsmin_foldX,0,1,The minimum fold increase in area that a colony must have at some point within the growth window. Can be used to filter out e.g. dead cellsmin_neighbor_dist,100,1,The minimum distance in pixels that a colony must be from its closest neighbor in order to be included in growth rate calculations. Because colonies that are close to each other tend to collide too early for their growth rates to be calculated having colonies be too close to each other at the start of the experiment will bias counting towards slow-growing colonies that don't have a chance to collide before reaching enough timepoints to fulfill the growth_window_timepoints cutoffmax_colony_num,1000,1,The maximum number of colonies allowed in an image; images with more colonies detected will be treated as blank. This is an important failsafe in case thresholding fails. It should be an order of magnitude higher than the expected number of colonies. Setting this number to >10000 is not recommended as tracking images with that many colonies may result in out-of-memory errors
